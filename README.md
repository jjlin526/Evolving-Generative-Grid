# Evolving Generative Grid
* The background colors are lerped based on their RGB components
* The colors change organically over time on a 25 x 25 compass grid
* The angle of the compass is determine based on a 3D noise value generated by its XY coordinates, and the frame count
* The mouse's horizontal position determines the rate of rotation (based on Perlin noise) of the compasses and the rate of color change
* The compass length and color becomes more chaotic as the cursor moves to the left
